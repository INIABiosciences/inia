This innovative approach works         by targeting the body's autonomic nervous system, particularly the vagus nerve, which         plays a crucial role in immune regulation. By sending controlled electrical signals         to the spleen, the device helps modulate immune responses, reducing excessive inflammation         that contributes to psoriasis flare-ups. Unlike traditional treatments such as         immunosuppressants or topical creams, this non-invasive method offers a drug-free alternative         with minimal side effects. Clinical studies have demonstrated significant reductions in          psoriasis symptoms after consistent use, highlighting the potential for wearable          bioelectronic therapy as a breakthrough in inflammatory disease management. With further          advancements, this technology could revolutionize treatment for a wide range of autoimmune           and inflammatory conditions, providing a convenient and effective solution for patients.    </p>  </body></html>"
